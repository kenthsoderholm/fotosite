#Fotosite

An assignment for school. 

Description:

A photosite where uploaders can upload pictures, 'the site' then creates a thumbnail and a watermarked version of the image and saves all images on server.
Uploaders have rights to add categories (which are there but not implemented yet), upload images, and also delete images (for the moment any uploader can delete any image).

Now version 0.1 is up and running.
You can see it live at http://fotosite.kenthsoderholm.se
The site may seem buggy, but this was a school project and we had to have a classmate that did something to the css via git.
I will restore my old .css file after this weekend (today is oct 25 2012).

For future versions I will add more filetypes for upload. Just jpegs now.
